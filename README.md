## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables

**questions**
- Stores all SAT questions with content arrays, answer choices, correct answers
- Organized by test_id, module_number, and question_number
- Includes difficulty ratings and video explanation tracking

**test_attempts**
- Stores user test submissions with JSONB modules structure
- Tracks user answers, time spent per question, and correctness
- Calculates and stores scaled scores (Reading & Writing, Math, Total)

**users**
- User profiles with email, username, role
- Supports student/teacher/admin roles
- Tracks gems balance for gamification features

## 🎯 Key Features Implementation

### Adaptive Testing Algorithm
The platform implements College Board's adaptive testing logic:
- Module 1 performance determines Module 2 difficulty
- Module 3 performance determines Module 4 difficulty
- Scoring tables adjust based on module difficulty levels

### Section-Based Filtering
Results page supports three views via URL parameters:
- `?section=full` - Complete test results
- `?section=rw` - Reading & Writing only (blue theme)
- `?section=math` - Math only (orange theme)

### Real-time Score Calculation
- Uses official SAT scoring conversion tables
- Accounts for adaptive module difficulty
- Provides instant feedback on test completion

## 🔒 Security & Performance

- Server-side rendering for optimal performance
- Client-side state management for interactive features
- Row-level security policies (ready for implementation)
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Authenticity**: Matches the official Digital SAT interface and experience
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high contrast mode
- **Performance**: Fast load times, smooth animations, optimized bundle size
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture supporting multiple tests and question types

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Video explanations for questions
- [ ] Custom practice sets by topic
- [ ] Teacher dashboard for student tracking
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)
- [ ] AI-powered study recommendations

## 📄 PDF parsing scripts

There are scripts to extract questions from practice PDF files and convert them to a JSON format suitable for importing into the database.

Usage:
```
npm run parse:pdf -- ./public/testpdf/PRACTICE\ TEST\ 90.pdf --testId=90 --out=parsed_90.json
node scripts/json_to_sql.js parsed_90.json > update_questions.sql
```

Notes: The parsing is heuristic and needs manual validation; it will not extract images. Use the exported SQL to update the `questions` table in Supabase.
